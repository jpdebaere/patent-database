## About this Database
To find patents that have merely expired you can simply set your search terms to look for patents that are 20 years old or older. However, finding a list of inactive patents is far more challenging. This website overcomes that challenge as it allows you to search through all inactive patents in the U.S. that are less than 20 years old. We created this database to help drive open source hardware (OSH) development. Our previous work has found that [patents should be significantly weakened](https://www.academia.edu/11677580/The_Case_for_Weaker_Patents) as they are actively retarding innovation and technical progress. By properly [valuing open hardware development](https://www.academia.edu/10143203/Quantifying_the_Value_of_Open_Source_Hard-ware_Development) it is clear that the [return on investment for OSH development is enormous](https://www.academia.edu/13799962/Return_on_Investment_for_Open_Source_Hardware_Development). In addition, [proactive measures to defend the public domain](http://www.appropedia.org/A_novel_approach_to_obviousness:_An_algorithm_for_identifying_prior_art_concerning_3-D_printing_materials) can also provide more safe space for innovators to operate. Our hope is that this database accelerates your open hardware development.

## About Us

[The MichiganTech Open Sustainability Technology](http://www.appropedia.org/Category:MOST) (MOST) lab focuses on open and applied sustainability, which is the application of science and innovation to ensure a better quality of life for all, now and into the future, in a just and equitable manner, whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems.

We have a [strong open access policy](http://www.appropedia.org/MOST_open_access_policy) for our own work:
